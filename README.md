## Technologies Used
- HTML - used to create elements on the DOM
- CSS - styles html elements on page
- Git - version control system to track changes to source code
- GitHub - hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages

## Summary 

The purpose of the assignment was to refactor an existing website using the prompt and parameters below.

```
User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
The assignment was then graded upon the following criteria:

1. Semantic HTML
2. Logical Structure
3. Accessible Alt Attributes
4. Sequential Header Elements
5. Concise & Descriptive Title

```
Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Code Snippet

Below is an example of a block of code where I refactored the spacing and indentation as well as added semantic Header tags.

```html
    <!-- Added Header tags & fixed spacing/indentation -->
    <header class="header">
        <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n
        </h1>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization
                    </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#online-reputation-management">Online Reputation Management
                    </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#social-media-marketing">Social Media Marketing
                    </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </header>
```
